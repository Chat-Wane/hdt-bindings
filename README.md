# hdt-bindings

## Note on install:

You must ```git clone git@github.com:rdfhdt/hdt-cpp.git``` in root
directory of this project, for it is not automated yet.

Then you can use it using ```pip``` or as ```poetry``` dependency.

## Note on contribution:

Feel free to modify the python API (in ```src/hdt.cpp```) as you
like. Examples to do so are in this source file. You can even modify
the building pipe for python.

For changes on other ```.cpp``` files, this is subject to discussion.

## Disclaimer

Not documented ```:)```. The python API mimics rust one, but it's not
mandatory.
